📝 Description
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a SQL-based data warehouse, including schema design, ETL processes, and analytical queries. It simulates a real-world business intelligence system using structured data from multiple sources, integrated into a star/snowflake schema for optimized reporting and analytics.

The project uses SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server) to build the warehouse, transform data using ETL scripts, and generate insights via complex queries. Ideal for learning data warehousing concepts, dimensional modeling, and data analytics.



🎯 Objective
Design a dimensional model (Star/Snowflake schema) for business data.

Implement ETL pipelines to extract, clean, transform, and load data.

Populate fact and dimension tables with realistic sample datasets.

Perform analytical queries for business reporting and KPI monitoring.

Showcase data warehouse capabilities for decision support systems.
